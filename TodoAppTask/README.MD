This iPadOS app was built using SwiftUI and designed specifically for the larger screen layout of iPads. It uses a split view layout so you can see your task groups on the left and open details on the right, which makes it easy to stay organized and multitask. The interface adjusts smoothly in portrait or landscape and also works when the app is used side-by-side with another app using Split View or Slide Over.

I made sure the layout responds to different size classes, so the sidebar can collapse when the screen gets smaller. The design keeps everything simple, with easy navigation and large tap targets that feel natural on iPad.

For localization, I added English and Spanish using a String Catalog. That way all the text updates automatically depending on the user’s language settings. It also makes future translations easier to manage.

Overall, the app feels like a native iPad experience—clean, responsive, and built for multitasking without losing focus on usability.
